This calculator application is built using a while loop to repeatedly display a menu with various options, including basic arithmetic operations and unique feature for calculating daily caloric burn. The user inputs their choice, and functions handle the calculations. For the caloric burn feature, user inputs for age, height, weight, sex, and lifestyle are used to calculate daily caloric burn. Integrating the new feature without disrupting existing functionality was a challenging task, but by defining different functions for each feature, this problem was solved. Another challenge was ensuring existence of valid exit, which was solved by adding option for exit.
